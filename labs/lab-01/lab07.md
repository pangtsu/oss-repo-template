Words

Words/Ladder Graph
------------------
Generate  an undirected graph over the 5757 5-letter words in the
datafile `words_dat.txt.gz`.  Two words are connected by an edge
if they differ in one letter, resulting in 14,135 edges. This example
is described in Section 1.1 in Knuth's book (see [1]_ and [2]_).
