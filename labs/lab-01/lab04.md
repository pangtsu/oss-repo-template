**Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?**
- It is important to choose a license because with so many new businesses appearing every day, ensuring your businesses is registered and licensed helps to formalise the economy. It ensures the businesses sector is thriving, as well as strong and protected. Small businesses can also only gain funding or protection by the law once they are registered and licensed.

**Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?**
- If we don't know about the license of a project, we may violate rights unkowningly while using it. Severe consequences might occur, e.g., business failure, lawsuit, etc.

**Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?**
- I agree with this claim as I think that a larger community involvement is always better than working alone. The Gopher team relied too hevaily on themselves that they forgot to open up to others. This is not a good attitude when it comes to open source development. 

**Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.**
- Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).
    - Linux uses GPL v2 license because Linux does not require contributors to assign copyright to some central person. Copyright on it is spread out among many, many people. Most importantly, GPL v2 guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software, and this is exactly what Linux wants.
