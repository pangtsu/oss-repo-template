# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

1. **Reading assignments** 
- Eric Raymond's article [Smart Questions]: list 2 suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way.
  - Check your code carefully. Often it’s a careless mistake i.e., typo that led to the problem. 
  - Know what you’re saying and asking. Do not post a question without knowing what you’re doing. This does not only confuse   yourself, but also others.

  This chapter basically describes how a former undergraduate students at RPI, Jasse Jordan, brought the Internet much closer to all of us by improving the quality of search on the network. The search engine used Microsoft’s network file system to build an index of all the files available within the RPI network. In fact, the single most important improvement over those engines Jesse built was that he fixed a bug within the Microsoft file-sharing system that could cause a user’s computer to crash. From copies of notes of research to the university brochures, Jesse had more than 1 million files in his directory only six months into its launch. However, on April 3, 2003, Jesse received a law suit from the RIAA for violating copyright laws. The RIAA demanded $12000 from Jesse to dismiss the cases as well as a confession from Jesse that he was doing something wrong. Jesse refused. Eventually, Jesse was faced with 2 choices: $250,000 for continuing with the lawsuit, or $12,000, a settlement, and a stain on Jesse’s future career. The reporter questioned as where is the morality in taking money from a student for running a search engine. On June 23, Jesse wired his saving to the lawyer working for the RIAA. The case against him was then dismissed. And with this, the kid who had tinkered a computer into a $15 million lawsuit beame an activist.
